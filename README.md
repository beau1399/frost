Higher-level language and runtime for 8-bit Microchip Technology PIC microcontrollers

## Overview

**Frost** is a new language specifically tailored to the capabilities of Microchip Technology PIC microcontrollers, and to the real-time, embedded, and low-cost / low budget millieus in which they have traditionally been most at home. This repository holds the Linux-hosted version of the Frost cross-compiler; the Windows version is hosted in my blog hosted at [here](http://beauscode.blogspot.com/2013/02/language-and-development-tool-for.html).

* Subroutines, functions and parameters    
* A 16-bit, general-purpose real number type ("SFP")    
* Event handlers, with automatic preemption and constant interrupt latency 
* Serial I/O and ANSI terminal support   
* Support for string literals and look-up tables  
* Modular, expandable runtime library 
* Macros  
* Full support for PIC features (timers, analog sensing and signal generation, etc.) 
 * Extensive facilities for portability, e.g. between "mid-range" and "enhanced mid-range" devices, and to other Microchip Technology devices
